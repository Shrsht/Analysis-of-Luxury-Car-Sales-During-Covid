# Analysis-of-Luxury-Car-Sales-During-Covid

The goal of this Project is to study and identify correlations between COVID-19 positive cases and purchases of luxury cars and houses in the United States. We use COVID-19 positive cases as an approximation of severity of public health situation at a point of time since it is close to how COVID-19 pandemic was addressed in the news and by the officials. The idea of this question was driven by our prior knowledge of difference between luxury goods and necessities and their theoretical response to different economic situations. We found that there was no relationship between total number of COVID-19 cases and house sales or car sales based on the results of linear regression models.


## Background


The COVID-19 pandemic reached major headlines across national news by inflicting a major impact upon the globe. While the pandemic contributed a major impact in terms of health to the entire globe, it has also affected everyone in terms of their ways of life. Specifically, the economy was heavily impacted on a large scale, ultimately falling onto each invidiual (Crosta).

Consumer behavior had changed as a result of pandemic in which people transitioned from spending much of their money on non-necessity items, such as clothing and entertainment, to taking a percentage of such set of items to necessity items for survivial such as food and water (Crosta).

Furthermore, the pandemic has suggested new ways in which people can adapt to new purchasing and safety regulations set in place for people to partake in. A transition from people physically going in-person to an area of commerce, to accessing much of the items online, concerns of health had been a major factor to driving the transition of consumer preferences. Additionally, the high prevelence that social media (Whatsapp, TikTok, etc.) has played when it comes to exposing the userbase to new things (Sheth).

There is current research on the effect of COVID-19 on many topics such as physical and mental health, socialization, and businesses. A previous sentiment analysis project at UC San Diego over the course of COVID-19 pandemic, concluded that students believed that UC San Diego underperformed in adapting to COVID (Group 043 Fall 2021).

Such discussion is relevant to the analysis we are exploring with regards to consumer preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, this allows us to be able formulate exactly how consumers are responding when met with a health crisis.

## Results:

We wanted to study and identify correlations between COVID-19 positive cases and purchases of luxury cars and houses in the United States. We chose this topic because COVID-19 affected the globe, and it was interesting for us to see how the global pan(dem)ic influenced personal finances, especially on the level of goods which are considered as luxury, and property (houses).

We used COVID-19 positive cases as an approximation of severity of public health situation at a point of time since it is close to how COVID-19 pandemic was addressed in the news and by the officials. We found that there was no relationship between total number of COVID-19 cases and house sales or car sales based on the results of linear regression models with standard alpha-level of 0.05.
